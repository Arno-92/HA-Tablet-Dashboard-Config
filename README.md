Running HA OS on a Raspberry Pi 3B+. Using an Amazon Fire HD 10 running Android WallPanel for the dashboard.

**Credit where credit is due:**
The layout of the dashboard was heavily inspired by matt8707's tablet dashboard, which you can find here: https://github.com/matt8707/hass-config. I reused some of the button-card templates, replaced the sidebar with a vertical-stack-in-card, and deleted the custom icon config so I could use the built-in MDI icons.

I'm sure there's probably code in there I don't need, as the actual card config doesn't even start until line 2696 ðŸ˜‚... however it's been working great for me for more than 6 months now, so I haven't seen a reason to waste time removing it.

It's not necessary, but I recommend enabling the theme.yaml file on your tablet, as I designed this dashboard with that theme in mind. It's a smattering of stock HA, UI-Lovelace-Minimalist, and matt8707's theme, so it's a total mess too, but should work just fine.
